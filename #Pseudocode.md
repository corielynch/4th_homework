#Pseudocode

First, there should be a button confirm asking if the user is ready to play, as the timer will begin after clicking "Ok."
Then, there should be a start game function that also begins the start timer function of 30 seconds. The start game should trigger the first question and multiple choice answers.  
The user will answer 5 multiple choice questions, with a "Correct" or "Incorrect" signal at the bottom of each question based on the user input. If the user is wrong on one of the questions, the starttimer function should reduce by 5 seconds.
After 30 seconds, or upon the completion of the 5 questions, the "Finish Page" will appear and user will receive their totaled score. They will be asked to write their initials to save their score.
High scores are then displayed based on past participants.
