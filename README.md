# 4th_homework

This is a 5 question, timed, multiple choice quiz based on JavaScript questions I made up.
The user will receive a prompt to begin the timed quiz. The user will then receive messages if their response is right or wrong. After the time has run out or the user has completed all 5 questions, their score will appear on the screen. The user has an option to write their initials and the high scores will be saved and displayed.
